The files of this repo. are as follows:

1. 1_GCC-PHAT.ipyhb: This source file uses GCC-PHAT and standard cross-correlation to compute different signals' correlations.
   
   To view the code and the result without running, you can simply open its HTML page (static/1_GCC-PHAT.html).

   We also provide the online version of this code, which allows you to run the code in the browser. The following is the link
